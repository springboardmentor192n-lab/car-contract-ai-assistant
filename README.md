# 🚗 Car Contract AI – Smart Lease Contract Analyzer

## 📌 Project Overview

Car Contract AI is a full-stack web application that analyzes car lease contracts and helps users understand important terms, detect risks, and receive negotiation suggestions.

The system extracts key financial details, evaluates fairness, and generates a downloadable report for better decision-making.
