Car Lease AI is an AI-powered web application that analyzes car lease contracts using OCR and Large Language Models.
It extracts and understands unstructured contract text to answer user questions accurately.
The system uses semantic search with vector embeddings and FAISS for context retrieval.
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline ensures responses are grounded in the contract.
It also supports vehicle information lookup using VIN via public government APIs.
The application is built with Python, Flask, and modern NLP frameworks.
